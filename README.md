# 🏅 Olympic Medals Visualization using MATLAB

This MATLAB project visualizes Olympic medal data for multiple countries using bar charts. It shows the distribution of gold, silver, and bronze medals and highlights the global ranking of each country on a dual-axis plot.

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Practice working with .mat files and data visualization in MATLAB
- Learn how to use *bar charts, **stacked plots, and **dual y-axes*
- Represent complex data (medals + rankings) in an easy-to-understand graph
- Explore Data with MATLAB plots
- MATLAB Desktop tools and Troubleshooting Scripts
